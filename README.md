# C--


The goal of this project is to develop a programming language along with a compiler that can pass the high-level code into the MIPS language.
The language is called C--, because the syntax we have chosen is very similar to the already existing in languages such as C or C ++.
Because the number of hours that can be devoted to the project is limited, the functionalities of the language are very limited, as we only have one type (int), basic operations (sums, subtractions), logical operators (<,> and ==) along with if and while.

For more information on the differents steps of the project and how are those developed, you can refer to "cminusminus.pdf" (Automatic translation from catalan to english, you will probably find many translation errors).
